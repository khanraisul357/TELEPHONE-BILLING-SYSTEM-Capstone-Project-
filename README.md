Telephone Billing System – Project Description

The Telephone Billing System is a C-based software application designed to streamline and automate the billing process for telephone services. It ensures accurate tracking of calls, bill calculation, and payment management. The system incorporates the following key features:

User Authentication – Allows users to register and log in securely.
Call Log Management – Stores call details, including date, time, duration, and recipient.
Automated Bill Generation – Calculates call costs based on predefined tariff rates.
Payment Simulation – Enables users to clear dues and track payments.
Report Generation – Displays billing statements summarizing call history and charges.
One of the primary functions of this system is User Authentication, which ensures that only registered users can access their billing information. The Call Log Management module records all call transactions and provides a structured way to retrieve and analyze call data. The Automated Bill Generation feature calculates call costs based on the duration and applicable rates, incorporating any additional service charges. To enhance user convenience, the Payment Simulation module allows customers to simulate bill payments, helping them keep track of their financial transactions.

To ensure transparency and easy monitoring, the system includes a Report Generation feature that provides users with detailed billing statements, displaying call usage, total charges, and payment history. The Telephone Billing System is ideal for small telecom service providers, educational projects, or personal use to gain insights into real-world billing mechanisms. Future improvements could involve database integration, graphical user interfaces (GUI), and real-time payment processing to make the system more scalable and efficient. This project enhances knowledge in file handling, data structures, and algorithm design, making it a valuable addition to system development experience.
